        "When Semele strode around bragging about her boyfriend being the god of the sky, " +
        "Hera disguised herself as an human and asked Semele if she had any proof he was actually Zeus. " +
        "Peeved, Semele demanded Zeus prove to her his godly nature, by revealing his true glory. " +
        "Zeus refused, but she insisted. When he showed his true self, the glory was too much, " +
        "and Semele disintegrated, leaving behind the unborn baby Dionysos. " +
        "Zeus managed to sow Dionysos into his thigh, where the baby grew healthy. ",

        // Third text
        "Zeus resides on Mount Olympus as king of the gods. " +
        "He rules over the sky and over his brothers, who are kings in their own right. " +
        "Despite being one of the most powerful beings in existence, Zeus' rule is under a constant threat. " +
        "Many Romans believed his son Apollo would overthrow him and become a new king. " +
        "It was prophesised Athena, his daughter, could defeat him if she chose so. " +

        "All this caused some of Zeus' behaviour to be erratic and paranoid. "
